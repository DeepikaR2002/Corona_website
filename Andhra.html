    The Andhra Pradesh government led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan 
    Reddy is making key decisions regarding coronavirus outbreak. As part 
    of that, the government has included Coronavirus medical procedures 
    under Aarogyasri. The government has fixed the rates for treatment 
    and medical fees in the wake of private hospitals being accused of 
    making large sums of money from patients.
        VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Wednesday fixed the ceiling rates 
    for various packages of Covid-19 treatment in hospitals. It had earlier 
    issued orders including the 15 Covidâ€“19 procedures under the Aarogyasri 
    scheme. As per the suggestions of a technical committee chaired by Special 
    Chief Secretary (Health) KS Jawahar Reddy, the per-day cost for Covid-19 
    treatment includes charges for medical personnel, PPE, disinfection,
    investigations, medicines and nutrition, among other things. 

       Non-critical Covid-19 treatment will cost Rs 3,250 per day, and in non- 
    Aarogyasri hospitals, if a patient prefers to stay in a private room, an 
    additional Rs 600 may be charged. Indications of Covid-19 that requires non-critical care are fever, sore throat, cough, and a normal chest X-ray. 
    An abnormal chest X-ray would signify need for critical care ICU without 
    ventilator support. Indications for critical care ICU with NIV and 
    oxygenation are abnormal chest X-ray and SPO2 less than 94.</pre>
